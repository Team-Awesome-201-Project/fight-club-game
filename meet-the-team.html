        <p>Matteus has an extensive background in Customer Service and Major Sales, as well as some experience in Supply Chain Management. He had always been interested in becoming a Software Dev and for good reason, most of his family had worked in the Tech industry. He had taken a few classes years apart but between balancing work, he thought he would never be able to explore the endless possibilities that the Tech Industry and experiences that Software Devs have, but after a being referred to CodeFellows from a mutual friend, he decided to take his first and most important step in becoming a Dev. He is interested in Full Stack, watching and experimenting with the interactions between programs and code, and can't wait to take the next steps in his education for Software Development. </p>

        <p>Amy was an accountant for over 25 years and spent a lot of that time listening to devs talk about cool stuff and wondering how it all worked. Then while she was thinking about her second act, she daughter was taking a Java class. She started learning to code to help with homework, and enjoyed it so much she wanted to do more.
          I'm particularly interested in Full Stack development because I like to understand how and why things interact with each other and I like to be able to do all the things. I think I will eventually settle down into back end work, but I'm still exploring what I enjoy most.
